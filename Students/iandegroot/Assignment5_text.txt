The SensorData abstract class can be extended to contain the data for any android sensor because it contains the data fields that all sensors have in common. These fields are private and can only be accessed using the get methods that have been defined. An abstract method get data is also declared that will enable each sensor to return its data as a vector of strings. Strings were selected because they can be used to represent almost any other data type and a vector was selected because it is able to fit a data collection of any size.

The SensorCollection interface defines an interface that can be implemented to provide a way of storing the sensor data and loading it into the database. The array list data will contain SensorData objects, or more specifically objects of classes that extend the SensorData abstract class, that can be loaded into the database using the loadDataToDB method.
