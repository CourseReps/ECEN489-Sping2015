Assignments and Opt-Out Challenges
==================================

Engineering students possess vastly different programming skills and experience.
This situation can make it difficult for instructors to create activities from which everyone can benefit.
To address this situation, this course features two types of assignments.
The basic exercises focus on the fundamentals of the Java programming language, with elementary questions and complementary programming challenges.
Every opt-out assignment typically consists of a programming challenge that showcases a mastery of pertinent programming concepts.
On every occasion, students must elect to complete the basic assignment or the opt-out challenge, but not both.
Seasoned programmers are strongly encouraged to choose the latter option, and may be forced to attempt the opt-out challenge is some instances.
The opt-out challenge is graded as satisfactory (full credit) or unsatisfactory (no credit); a working prototype must be presented in class.


Progression of Opt-Out Challenges
---------------------------------

1. Getting started with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Establishing a server-client infrastructure in [Java](https://java.com/).
3. Managing data over the Internet with [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/).
4. Connecting to a Java server with an [Android](http://developer.android.com/) client.
5. Leveraging [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) in a server-client infrastructure.
6. Data visualization with [Google Fusion Tables](https://developers.google.com/fusiontables/).
