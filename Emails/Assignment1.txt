Dear Students,

You will find attached to this email Assignment 1 and Opt-Out Challenge 1.  The first assignment should be rather straightforward.  It is acceptable to write your answers directly on the question sheet.  You must submit a printed version of the question sheet, as it will be used to grade your solution. In addition, you will need to submit your Java code through GitHub.

Cheers,
Jean-Francois Chamberland, Gregory Huff
