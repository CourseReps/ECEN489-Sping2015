This project will allow users to be tracked in space and time.  Users will have the ability to "check in" to a series of predetermined locations and track the check-in activities of their friends.

This project is broken down into three major major subsystems (TENTATIVE):  
1. Server backbone **(SB)**  
2. Location identification **(LI)**  
3. User feedback **(UF)**  

The subsystems are further broken down into **X** functional components (TENTATIVE):  

Component Name | Language or API | Subsystem
--- | --- | ---
Server Database Management | Java/SQLite | SB
User Authentication/Credentials | ??? API | SB
MAC Address tracking | PCAP | SB
Social media integration | Facebook | SB  
Image processing/object identification | OpenCV | LI  
Facial recognition | OpenCV | LI  
QR Code reader | Android | LI  
Voice Recognition | ??? API | LI  
User application | Android | UF  
User greeting | Java or microcontroller? | UF  
to be continued... | |
