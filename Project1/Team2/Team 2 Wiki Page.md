Project 1 Team 2

PB - George

R2Data - Anudeep

TNS - Joshua

elCloudo - Rong

Most important:

Turn wificard into promiscious mode and detect MAC address.

Define an interface to push data from PB to R2Data

R2Data sent to TNS probably using wifi.

Server can communicate to the Android app and store data into a local sqlite database. Need to work on the format of the data and whether I am receiving a syrializable object.
TNS must sent to fusion table. Resolve auth issue.

Critical work done:

Interface for android is to receive and sent
