# Project 1: Passive Device Monitoring

This project focuses on identifying active [Wi-Fi](http://www.wi-fi.org/) devices using a network of wireless sensing nodes.
The sensors will collect network traffic meta data in monitor mode, also called [promiscuous mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode).
Monitor mode enables a Wi-Fi network interface card to capture certain aspects of Wi-Fi packets in an area, regardless of their source or intended destination.
Leveraging this information, it is possible to estimate useful parameters such as current population density, data traffic trends over a period of time, or most frequent visitors.

With this type of infrastructure, it is also possible to study the effect of antenna design on overall performance.
More specifically, the antenna radiation patterns associated with the acquisition devices will dictate which locations are surveyed by the sensor nodes.
By tuning the illuminated areas, it is possible to match the gathered data to the inference tasked at hand.
