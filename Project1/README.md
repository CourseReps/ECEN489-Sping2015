# Project 1: Passive Device Monitoring

This project focuses on identifying active [Wi-Fi](http://www.wi-fi.org/) devices using a network of wireless sensing nodes.
The sensors will collect network traffic meta data in monitor mode ([promiscuous mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promiscuous_mode)).
Monitor mode enables a Wi-Fi network interface card to capture certain aspects of Wi-Fi packets in an area, regardless of their source or intended destination.
Leveraging this information, it is possible to estimate useful parameters such as current population density, data traffic trends over a period of time, or most frequent visitors.
