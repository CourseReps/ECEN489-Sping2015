Not only is ScoutOut an innovative app quickly rising in the ranks of popularity, ScoutOut also serves as a great investment opportunity. With an initial angel investment of $675,000, ScoutOut is on course to becoming profitable in merely 9 months. With the continued growth of users and venues, we are expected to have annual revenue of $10,000,000 in the year of 2017.

ScoutOut has a business plan revolving around venue sponsorship and advertisements. Every company has the opportunity to pay a low monthly fee to receive a unique identifying number to recognize them as sponsors and allow our users to check in easier at their location. Our intentions are to never charge the users of the app for using our services. We encourage sharing and active participation of our app to increase use.

With a conservative estimate of only 10,000 locations participating after one year of accessibility, we estimate for the growth to occur faster due to a wider viewership. A calculation of roughly 30,000 venues will be participating by the end of 2018.

Our user base is the core of our product. A higher number of users will be the encouraging factor for more venues to participate while they also share the app with their friends. With an industry average of $40/1000 impressions on an ad banner, 100,000 users using the app with a conservative estimate of once every 3 days, generated revenue from advertisements will be $400,000. We expect at least 1 million active users by the end of fiscal year 2018.
