* Pranay Kumar Eedara, epranaykumar: OpenCV

### RF
The RF subsystem will design and paramaterize the RF antenna for the microcontroller

### MicroController (MC)
The MC subsystem will work with the server and RF to control antenna gain and run a "ping" sensor to determine if someone is in front of the television

### Server/Sensing
The server/sending subsystem will perform MAC sniffing and send directives to the MC and Facial Recognition subsystems to play video and take snapshots of people when there is a MAC address detected in the area of interest.

### Facial Recognition (OpenCV)
The facial recognition subsystem will attract the victim's attention by playing a video on a screen.  It will also take pictures of the area of interest when there is a MAC address overlap detected, then pick out faces of the people in this area.
