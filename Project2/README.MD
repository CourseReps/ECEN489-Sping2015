Project 2: Big Brother NSA 2.0
====================================

This project will be build on top of Project 1 using statistics/ analytics of MACs. Four sensing stations will be set up
to focus on a central area.  When a MAC address is sensed in this overlapped area, a picture will be taken using
a camera next to tv.  This system will try to link a person to the mac address and possibly the image.
